### Simulating Forces

#### Gravity

#### Recovery

#### Wind

#### Total force

### Culling tests

#### Orientation culling

#### View-frustum culling

#### Distance culling

#### Occlusion culling (extra credit)

This type of culling only makes sense if our scene has additional objects aside from the plane and the grass blades. We want to cull grass blades that
are occluded by other geometry. Think about how you can use a depth map to accomplish this!

## Third-Party Code Policy

* Use of any third-party code must be approved by asking on our Google Group.
* If it is approved, all students are welcome to use it. Generally, we approve
  use of third-party code that is not a core part of the project. For example,
  for the path tracer, we would approve using a third-party library for loading
  models, but would not approve copying and pasting a CUDA function for doing
  refraction.
* Third-party code **MUST** be credited in README.md.
* Using third-party code without its approval, including using another
  student's code, is an academic integrity violation, and will, at minimum,
  result in you receiving an F for the semester.


## README

* A brief description of the project and the specific features you implemented.
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A performance analysis (described below).

### Performance Analysis

The performance analysis is where you will investigate how...
* Your renderer handles varying numbers of grass blades
* The improvement you get by culling using each of the three culling tests

## Submit

If you have modified any of the `CMakeLists.txt` files at all (aside from the
list of `SOURCE_FILES`), mentions it explicity.
Beware of any build issues discussed on the Google Group.

Open a GitHub pull request so that we can see that you have finished.
The title should be "Project 6: YOUR NAME".
The template of the comment section of your pull request is attached below, you can do some copy and paste:  

* [Repo Link](https://link-to-your-repo)
* (Briefly) Mentions features that you've completed. Especially those bells and whistles you want to highlight
    * Feature 0
    * Feature 1
    * ...
* Feedback on the project itself, if any.
